title: "Enabling rack-scale confidential computing using heterogeneous trusted execution environment"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/paper-HETEE
excerpt: 'This work addresses the scalability and security limitations of current TEEs in supporting high-throughput accelerators (GPUs/FPGAs). We propose HETEE, the first heterogeneous TEE design that enables large-scale, compute-intensive confidential computing without requiring any hardware changes to existing chips. By leveraging PCIe ExpressFabric and resource pooling, HETEE dynamically isolates computing tasks and minimizes the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) through a novel security controller architecture. Experimental results on real hardware demonstrate that HETEE supports production-scale AI tasks with negligible performance overhead—less than 2.17% for inference and 0.95% for training.'
